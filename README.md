# EMG-RMS-MeanMedianFrequency
A basic amplitude and frequency analysis for EMG signals.
In this project the following parameters were specifically requested: mean, median and slope of change for RMS, mean power frequency and median power frequency in the first 10%, 20%, ...., 100% of the data.
The main file is kahrizi.m which browses an EMG data which is stored in a txt file with different channels in columns.
The main file calls three functions to calculate root mean squares (RMS), median power frequency, and mean power frequency.
